## Why this site exists

I’m building **hinett.dev** as a place to document my journey into **cybersecurity** — not just the end results, but the *process*.

A lot of student portfolios focus on polished outcomes. This site is deliberately different: it’s a collection of **projects, experiments, mistakes, fixes, and write-ups** that show how I think about problems and how my skills develop over time.

My long-term goal is to work in cybersecurity. Right now, my focus is on building strong **fundamentals** and learning how real systems fail — and how to make them safer.

## What I’m focusing on right now

At this stage, I’m not locking myself into a single cybersecurity niche. Instead, I’m exploring areas that cut across most roles:

### Application security fundamentals
- Understanding common web vulnerabilities
- Seeing how small mistakes lead to real impact
- Learning how to fix issues properly, not just “patch” them

### Detection & defensive thinking
- Thinking about attacker behaviour
- Understanding what *signals* malicious activity produces
- Learning how logs and detections actually work in practice

### Clear communication
Security work only matters if you can **explain it clearly**:
- What went wrong
- Why it mattered
- How it was fixed
- What could still be improved

This site is as much about **communication** as it is about code.

## How projects on this site are structured

For each project or write-up, I try to follow a consistent structure:

1. **Problem** – what I set out to build or investigate  
2. **Threats / failure points** – what could realistically go wrong  
3. **Approach** – tools, design decisions, and trade-offs  
4. **Evidence** – code, screenshots, logs, or test results  
5. **Reflection** – what I learned and what I’d do differently next time  

I care more about *showing reasoning* than pretending everything went smoothly.

## What this site is (and isn’t)

**This site is:**
- A learning log
- A portfolio of real work
- A place to experiment and improve

**This site is not:**
- A claim that I’m already an expert
- A collection of copied tutorials
- A finished product

Everything here is a work in progress — and that’s intentional.

---

## What’s coming next

In the short term, I’m working on:
- A small **deliberately vulnerable web app**, followed by a secure rewrite
- A basic **detection lab** using logs and simple rules
- Short write-ups from security labs and exercises

Over time, this site will grow alongside my skills.

If you’re a student, engineer, or recruiter reading this — thanks for stopping by.  
Feedback is always welcome.
